# simple scoring script

#pull tube into jaw
tube in at 0.75 from 0 to 0.5

# drive slowly off the start for 1 second
drive forward at 0.25 from 0.5 to 1.5

# line follow and raise the arm
follow from 1.5 to 7.5
arm high at 3

# should be stopped at wall by line-follower
# so drive forward just a bit to get tube on peg
drive forward at 0.25 from 7.5 to 8

# now score: roll tube down, open the jaw, turn and pull back
tube rolldown at 1.0 from 8 to 8.5
jaw open from 8.35 to 9
turn left at .75 from 8.75 to 9
drive backward at 1 from 8.75 to 9.5
